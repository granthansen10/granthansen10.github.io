    "text": "That’s a statement that likely every Husker fan who has followed the program closely in the last five years would agree with. Who could forget the first drive against Ohio State in 2018? Or the glorious four-play explosion of offense on the opening drive in the 2020 trip to Columbus that was punctuated by a Luke McCaffery 47 yard run? Or perhaps last week’s loss to Minnesota?\nAll of these instances have two things in common. Nebraska appeared to be invincible on script. Once the Huskers got off, they couldn’t sustain any momentum. They lost.\nSo is the first drive mayhem that was a major piece of the Scott Frost era real? Is it just a myth based in recency bias and dashed expectations?\nWell, the answer is somewhere in between.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\ndrives22<-cfbd_drives(\n  2022,\n  season_type = \"regular\"\n) %>%  \n  mutate(season=2022)\n\ndrives18<-cfbd_drives(\n  2018,\n  season_type = \"regular\"\n)%>%  \n  mutate(season=2018)\n\ndrives19<-cfbd_drives(\n  2019,\n  season_type = \"regular\"\n)%>%  \n  mutate(season=2019)\n\ndrives20<-cfbd_drives(\n  2020,\n  season_type = \"regular\"\n)%>%  \n  mutate(season=2020)\n\ndrives21<-cfbd_drives(\n  2021,\n  season_type = \"regular\"\n)%>%  \n  mutate(season=2021)\n\ndrives<-bind_rows(\n  drives22, drives21, drives20, drives19, drives18\n)\n\nYearlySuccess<-drives %>% \n  filter(drive_number<=2) %>% \n  group_by(offense, season, scoring) %>% \n  summarize(count = n()) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = scoring, values_from = count)%>% \n  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>% \n  mutate(GamesPlayed= `TRUE` + `FALSE`) %>% \n  group_by(offense, season) %>%  \n  summarize(\n  Score=sum(`TRUE`),\n  Total=sum(GamesPlayed)) %>%  \n  mutate(SuccessRate=Score/Total*100) %>% \n  filter(Total>5) %>% \n  arrange(desc(SuccessRate))\n\nnuplustop10<-YearlySuccess %>% \n  filter(offense==\"Nebraska\"|offense==\"Alabama\"|offense==\"Ohio State\"|offense==\"UCF\"|offense==\"Oklahoma\"|offense==\"North Carolina\"|offense==\"Georgia\"|offense==\"LSU\"|offense==\"UAB\"|offense==\"Air Force\"|offense==\"Oklahoma State\")\n\nnucolor<-nuplustop10 %>% filter(offense==\"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_line(data = nuplustop10, aes(x=season, y=SuccessRate, group=offense))+\n  geom_line(data = nucolor, aes(x=season, y=SuccessRate, group=offense), color=\"red\")+\n  facet_wrap(~offense)+\n  labs(title = \"Is Nebraska the best opening drive team of the last five years?\", subtitle = \"No, not even close.

Any instance of points scored on a team’s first offensive drive counts as an opening drive score (ODS).\nThe Huskers are No. 43 in the country. Certainly not in the bottom half of the FBS, but not good either. Nebraska isn’t the opening drive juggernaut that they can at times seem to be. That’s especially true when compared to the top ten teams of the last five seasons.\nThere are plenty of programs in here that aren’t a surprise such as Alabama and Ohio State. UCF is particularly impressive because of the coaching turnover present in Orlando. It’s also blatantly obvious that LSU suffered a major drop-off from 2019 to 2020 (I wonder why that would be?).\nAll in all, the Huskers just aren’t special here despite a great 2018 for opening drive scores.\n\n\nCode\nRecords18<-cfbd_game_records(2018)\n\nRecords19<-cfbd_game_records(2019)\n\nRecords20<-cfbd_game_records(2020)\n\nRecords21<-cfbd_game_records(2021)\n\nRecords22<-cfbd_game_records(2022)\n\nFiveYearRecords<-bind_rows(Records18, Records19, Records20, Records21, Records22)\n\nFiveYearWinRate<-FiveYearRecords %>% \n  group_by(team) %>% \n  summarize(\n  Total=sum(total_games),\n  Wins=sum(total_wins)\n) %>% \n  mutate(WinPercentage=Wins/Total*100)\n\n\nFiveYearSuccessRate<-drives %>% \n  filter(drive_number<=2) %>% \n  group_by(offense, season, scoring) %>% \n  summarize(count = n()) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = scoring, values_from = count) %>% \n  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>% \n  mutate(GamesPlayed= `TRUE` + `FALSE`) %>% \n  group_by(offense) %>% \n  summarize(\n  Score=sum(`TRUE`),\n  Total=sum(GamesPlayed)) %>%\n  mutate(SuccessRate=Score/Total) %>% \n  filter(Total>40) %>% \n  arrange(desc(SuccessRate))\n\nFiveYearTotals<-bind_rows(FiveYearWinRate, FiveYearSuccessRate)\n\nFiveYearTotals<-FiveYearWinRate %>% inner_join(FiveYearSuccessRate, by=c(\"team\"=\"offense\"))\n\nFiveYearNU<-FiveYearTotals %>% filter(team==\"Nebraska\"|team==\"Alabama\"|team==\"Ohio State\"|team==\"UCF\"|team==\"Oklahoma\"|team==\"North Carolina\"|team==\"Georgia\"|team==\"LSU\"|team==\"UAB\"|team==\"Air Force\"|team==\"Oklahoma State\"|team==\"San Diego State\"|team==\"Iowa\" |team==\"Akron\"| team==\"Michigan\"| team==\"Kansas\" |team==\"Georgia Southern\" | team==\"Northwestern\")\n\nnucolor<-FiveYearTotals %>% filter(team==\"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data=FiveYearTotals, aes(x=WinPercentage, y=SuccessRate), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data=FiveYearNU, aes(x=WinPercentage, y=SuccessRate), color=\"black\")+\n  geom_point(data=nucolor, aes(x=WinPercentage, y=SuccessRate), color=\"#E41C38\")+\n  geom_smooth(data=FiveYearTotals, aes(x=WinPercentage, y=SuccessRate), method = \"lm\", se=FALSE)+\n    geom_text_repel(data=FiveYearNU, aes(x=WinPercentage, y=SuccessRate, label=team))+\n    labs(\n    x=\"Win % Since 2018\", \n    y=\"Opening Drive Score %\", \n    title=\"Nebraska fails to win despite a decent opening drive score rate\", \n    subtitle=\"Compared to other teams in the FBS, Nebraska is vastly underperforming.\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbfastR | By: Grant Hansen\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face= \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check this metric against the most important stat in sports, win percentage.\nIt probably doesn’t come as a shock to many to see that Nebraska is underperforming here too. Using the fit line, one could predict that Nebraska should be winning roughly 70% of its games based on its ODS.\nIt’s difficult to say if scoring on a first drive is something that good teams do, or something that helps teams win with a higher frequency. The former seems much more likely in this scribe’s opinion. But with everything, there are always outliers.\nIowa and Michigan are great examples of teams that have struggled mightily on opening drives but continue to win at a high level. San Diego State and Georgia Southern are more extreme examples although they do play in an inferior conference.\nNebraska is on the opposite side of the chart to those programs. Not good.\n\n\nCode\ndrivesDB <- drives %>% \n  arrange(offense, game_id) %>% \n  group_by(offense, game_id) %>% \n  mutate(team_drive = row_number())\n\nopeningdrives <- drives %>% \n  filter(drive_number == 1 | drive_number == 2) %>% \n  filter(scoring == TRUE)\n\nod <- openingdrives %>% \n  select(game_id)\n\nDBDRIVESCHART<-drivesDB %>% \n  inner_join(od) %>% \n  filter(scoring == TRUE) %>% \n  mutate(whichscore = row_number()) %>%\n  filter(whichscore == 2) %>%\n  group_by(offense) %>% summarize(next_score = mean(team_drive)) %>% mutate(FirstDrive=1)\n\n\nJoining, by = \"game_id\"\n\n\nCode\nDBFiltered<-DBDRIVESCHART %>% \nfilter(offense==\"Nebraska\"|offense==\"Alabama\"|offense==\"Ohio State\"|offense==\"UCF\"|offense==\"Oklahoma\"|offense==\"North Carolina\"|offense==\"Georgia\"|offense==\"LSU\"|offense==\"UAB\"|offense==\"Air Force\"|offense==\"Oklahoma State\"|offense==\"San Diego State\"|offense==\"Iowa\" |offense==\"Akron\"| offense==\"Michigan\"| offense==\"Kansas\" |offense==\"Georgia Southern\" | offense==\"Northwestern\")\n\nnuDB<-DBDRIVESCHART %>% filter(offense==\"Nebraska\")\n\niwDB<-DBDRIVESCHART %>% filter(offense==\"Iowa\")\n\nmiDB<-DBDRIVESCHART %>% filter(offense==\"Michigan\")\n\ngsDB<-DBDRIVESCHART %>% filter(offense==\"Georgia Southern\")\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = DBFiltered,\n    aes(y=reorder(offense, next_score), x=FirstDrive, xend=next_score),\n    size= 2,\n    color=\" dark grey\"\n  )+\n    geom_dumbbell(\n    data = nuDB,\n    aes(y=reorder(offense, next_score), x=FirstDrive, xend=next_score),\n    size= 2,\n    color=\"#E41C38\"\n  )+\n   geom_dumbbell(\n    data = iwDB,\n    aes(y=reorder(offense, next_score), x=FirstDrive, xend=next_score),\n    size= 2,\n    color=\"#FFCD00\"\n  )+\n     geom_dumbbell(\n    data = miDB,\n    aes(y=reorder(offense, next_score), x=FirstDrive, xend=next_score),\n    size= 2,\n    color=\"#00274C\"\n  )+\n       geom_dumbbell(\n    data = gsDB,\n    aes(y=reorder(offense, next_score), x=FirstDrive, xend=next_score),\n    size= 2,\n    color=\"#87714D\"\n  )+\n   labs(\n    x=\"Average Drives Unitl Second Score\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"If Nebraska manages to score on its first drive...\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers take a signficant amount of possesions to score again.

Everyone in Memorial Stadium can sense it each week. They’ve been conditioned.\nOnce Nebraska scores, it takes the Huskers on average 4.3 drives to score again. Adjustment from the script that is practiced throughout the week to the regular course of the game is…difficult. There are three teams that have a worse ODS than Nebraska, but are much more capable of scoring again after a first-drive score. Those teams are Iowa, Michigan and Georgia Southern.\nSo, is the Frost Era First Drive Effect real?\nThe answer is, yes. Mostly. Nebraska isn’t the best in the country on opening drives but the crash that follows the good openers is very very real.\nBy far, Nebraska has scored a touchdown on their opening drive more than any other outcome in the last five seasons. The Huskers have had no issue scoring on the first drive either. That’s great.\nThe two most damning numbers are the difference between Nebraska’s ODS and the fit line, and that it takes Nebraska over four drives (almost a quarter) to score again.\nIt’s indicative of the failures brought to bear by the Husker coaching staff in the last few years. Failures to support the team off script and failure to adjust."
